                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to make interior design accessible to everyone. We provide a platform where you can experiment with different design elements and see how they would look in your own home before making any purchases. Interwood is a renowned name in the furniture and interior design industry in Pakistan. Known for their exquisite craftsmanship and modern designs, Interwood offers a wide range of furniture items and interior decor solutions, catering to both residential and commercial spaces. Their product line includes everything from stylish sofas, elegant dining sets, and comfortable beds to chic office furniture and sophisticated storage solutions. Additionally, Interwood provides an array of interior design services, helping customers create harmonious and aesthetically pleasing environments. Despite their comprehensive offerings, Interwood does not currently provide a virtual environment where customers can upload pictures of their rooms and visualize how new furniture, wall colors, or ceiling designs would look. This gap presents a unique opportunity to enhance the customer experience through a web application that allows users to virtually decorate their spaces, making more informed and confident purchasing decisions.</p>
